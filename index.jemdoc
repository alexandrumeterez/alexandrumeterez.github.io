I'm currently a Data Science MSc. student at [https://ethz.ch/en.html ETH ZÃ¼rich], advised by [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tQuQ1FwAAAAJ&hl=en Prof. Gunnar RÃ¤tsch]. Previously, I was a BSc. student at [https://upb.ro/en/ Politehnica University of Bucharest] under the supervision of [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HYZAnoYAAAAJ&hl=en Prof. Iuliu Vasilescu]. During my studies I have completed internships at [https://www.zurich.ibm.com/ IBM Research] and [https://www.adobe.com/ Adobe]. I am mainly interested in deep learning theory and the mathematical foundations of AI, as well as the applications of AI to healthcare. My main research interests are in:
- /Theory/: Deep Learning Theory, Optimization, Theory of Foundation Models
- /Applications/: Bioinformatics, AI in Healthcare

In my free time, I like to [https://github.com/alexandrumeterez tinker with various technologies], [https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/119387543-alexandru-meterez read] and ride or fix my bike.
